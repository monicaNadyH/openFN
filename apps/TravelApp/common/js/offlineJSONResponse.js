The beach has brightly painted changing rooms, a water sports center, a bar, and a restaurant. It is surrounded by crystal clear water on three sides, and the mountains of St Mary reach straight down to the sea, a sight that serves as the beach's backdrop. Its expansive lawns are a regular venue for concerts by international artists such as Rihanna, Ziggy Marley, and Lauryn Hill. \nScenes from the James Bond movie Dr. No were filmed at the beach. The two-story Moonraker bar, open on all sides, can hold up to 200 people, however, the only time it becomes full is during occasional jazz, blues, soca, andreggae concerts. The Bond-related décor is subdued, obvious only in the names of movies painted on small bamboo pieces that hang over the first-floor bar. It’s really popular for tourists with family especially with their children and also many celebrities.
